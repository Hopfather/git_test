      <h1>The Three Essentials</h1>
        <p>When it comes to Emergency Calltaking, there are <strong>Three</strong> core qualities that every dispatcher must master:</p>
      
        <h2>Diligence</h2>
        <p>The first Quality you must work to master is <em>Diligence</em>. It can be easy when things get stressful to cut corners or forget the basics, but this is a mistake. You must constantly reevaluate and determine if there are more tasks for you to complete.</p>
      
        <h2>Resilience</h2>
        <p><em>Resilience</em> in this case means your ability to bounce back after a bad call. It is much easier said than done. Taking a bad call can leave you in an emotionally compromised state. Learning different methods of returning youreself to a mental equilibrium can only help the longevity of your dispatching career.</p>
        <p>Doing certain activites like reading a book, knitting, or watching videos is a great way to destress and decouple your mind from the call you just took.</p>
      
        <h2>Patience</h2>
        <p>It happens to all of us. You answer the phone and the person on the other end is rude and denegrating. What do you do? It's only natural to be angry or frustrated in this situation. Maybe your hands start shaking, maybe you start to raise your voice. The best thing you can do in this situation is to remember to be <em>Patient!</em></p>
